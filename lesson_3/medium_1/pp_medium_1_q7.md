# Original answer:

No, the data does not get changed because you cannot use the += operator when changing values in a hash.  Therefore it exits with an error before it can get to the line that changes the gender information as that line WOULD have worked if the program made it there.

# After looking at solution:

So as evidenced above, I did believe that the program WOULD change the data if it didn't hit an error.  Apparently I was wrong about not being able to use the += operator with hash data so the answer is yes, the hash data is in fact changed.
