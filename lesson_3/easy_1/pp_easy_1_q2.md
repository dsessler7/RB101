The `!` when tacked on the end of a method, generally implies that the method mutates the caller or the argument passed into it.  It is also used in logical statements as a "not" operator, essentially reversing boolean values.
The `?` when tacked on the end of a method implies that the method returns a boolean.  It is also used in ternary operations which are essentially abbreviated if/else statements.

1. `!=` is a "not equal" operator and would be used in a conditional statement
2. putting a `!` before something will reverse its boolean value
3. putting a `!` after something generally makes it so that it mutates the caller or argument
4. putting a `?` before something sets up a conditional statment
5. putting a `?` after something generally makes it return a boolean value
6. putting `!!` before something leaves its truthiness as it is but forces the program to see the object as a boolean value whether the object held a boolean value to begin with or not
