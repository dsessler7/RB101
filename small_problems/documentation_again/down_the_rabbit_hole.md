# Down The Rabbit Hole

**Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.**

**In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:**

```ruby
require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
```

**Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.**
